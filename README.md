blackjack
=========

This is a simple 1 player vs dealer blackjack program.  It supports standard blackjack actions like hit, stay, split, and double.  It can also play computer vs dealer using the basic strategy.  Some effort was made to adapt it into a genetic algorithm in an attempt to find a strategy more optimal than the basic strategy, but that is still a work in progress.
